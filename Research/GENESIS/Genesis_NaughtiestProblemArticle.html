(H1) The Naughtiest Problem and Trifold Principle of PCG

(H2) The Naughtiest Problem

(H3) Introduction and History

'The Naughtiest Problem' is a toy problem encompassing the realization of extremely advanced and detailed 3D simulation worlds that are mostly if not fully procedurally generated by computers <vs> humans. More specifically: it invites discussion regarding the features, requirements, and constraints of such worlds; the definition of how much human-provded context, content, and otherwise design/direction is needed for their creation (as well as the theoretical mimimum/optimum levels thereof); and how worlds which are tied to a pre-written lore can thereto be correctly initialized to some specified state, consistently follow or mirror its remaining progression (and by what min error), and most interestingly - 'naturally' extend and expand itself past pre-existing [human-authored/directed] content.

I have been thinking about this problem for many years, and it was one of the primary reasons why I returned to college to study Computer Science; though I'm not necessarily alone in this pursuit. Almost everyone with the slightest creative mind has likely many times envisioned stepping into a fictional world, interacting with it (including directing its progression - both implicitly and explicitly), exploring an infinite numnber of alternate progressions/histories thereof, merging it with other universes including our own, and/or expanding it beyond the events described bt its authors/creators. Indeed there are entire genres of this; including 'Alternate History, 'Fan Fiction', and even smaller highly interconnected yet collaboratively decentralized universes such as that of 'The SCP Foundation', 'The Backrooms', Creepypastas, and video game mods. 

However, it was around 2017 when I started explore beyond the 'surface level' and commence a more serious contemplation to this problem and how to build a model thereto (which was also when it received its official and silly-yet-fitting name). To the latter, and as introduction to the problem itself: I was taking a graduate course in Computer Graphics at the time, for which the instructor was retired USAF Lt-Col Dr. Elton P Amburn. Having previously discussed both my interests in PCG and our mutual interests/experience with immersive Virtual Reality: I visited one of his office hours where, following a short greeting, I told him that I had a very naughty problem to discuss…

(H3) The Naughtiest Problem

In Algorithmics, problem definitions are often prefaced with the phrase 'Suggest an algorithm that…". The solution to the 'Naughtiest Problem' is not necessary a [standalone] algorithm, but likely [definitely] an entire arsenal of algorithms, data structures, agent programs, and etc. implementation alongside the greater architectural composition thereof. Nonetheless: I retain this prefix for tradition. With that said, the original description of this problem is as follows…

(QUOTE)
“Suggest an algorithm that takes as its 'content-input' the books, artwork, films, 3D models, and all other lore and multimedia encompassing the Tolkien Legendarium (i.e. the universe described and documented by Tolkien via The Silmarillion, Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, etc.): and outputs i.e. [procedurally] generates a highly detailed, realistic, and immersive interactive 3D simulation of Middle Earth (i.e. Arda); such that the world is 'Physically Stable' and 'Contextually Consistent'. The output will include all of the terrain, settlements, locations, landmarks, flora, fauna, sentient races, and minor (i.e. NPC) characters described by the input; as well as all of the well-known/described characters including their knowledge, memories, and personalities - WRT the specific point in the lore progression where the world is initialized. The world can be initialized at any point within the lore timeline such that all things and beings within are consistent thereto, will progress in a manner that best converges with the lore progression while tolerating human interaction (especially thereagainst), and can continue in a 'contextually stable / consistent manner' past the end of pre-existing lore".

In addition to the *'Content Input [Database]'* and as expansion of the other key ideas introduced within this original 'base' definition: latter additions speak further about the aforementioned 'features, requirements, and constraints' encompassing the initialization and progression of such worlds; for which there are currently three: *'Physical Stability'*, *'Contextual Consistency'*, and *'Spatiotemporal Synchronicity'* - which are described in the following section.

(H3) Multi-Level, Multi-Content PCG

In 2019 during preliminary research for a since suspended CS Master's Thesis project: I discovered a parallel if not analogous description of 'The Naughtiest Problem' as described within the introduction chapter of "Procedural Content Generation In Games" written by Shaker/Togelius/Nelson (which I understand to be the first textbook on on PCG for games/simulations). In the section discussing visions of the future [possibilities] of PCG, they introduce a content generator [system] called 'Multi-Level, Multi-Content PCG', which is described therein as follows:

(QUOTE)
"Multi-level, multi-content PCG refers to a content generator that, for a given game engine and set of game rules, would be able to generate all of the content for the game such that the content is of high quality and fits together perfectly. For example, given the engine and ruleset for the popular computer role-playing game [Elder Scrolls V]  Skyrim, this imaginary software would generate backstory, quests, characters, items, weapons, vegetation, terrain, graphics, etc. in such a fashion that it all becomes a coherent, believable new world and an enjoyable game to play." (PCGIG, pp. 5-6)

(H2) Trifold Principle Of Advanced PCG Worlds




>>> from the naughtiest problem: the 'Trifold Principle' is revealed…

The world is ‘Physically Stable’ (e.g. unintended events such as falling through floors, upside-down forests, houses floating in the air, and missing chunks of the world are highly unlikely); while also ‘Contextually Consistent’ (e.g. things such as Boeing 737 airliners flying over Gondor, US Army forces attacking a dragon, patches of snowy forest in the middle of a hot desert, cities where there shouldn’t be, orcs peacefully interacting with elves, etc. shouldn’t happen unless intented).

Lastly, a third principle follows from the aforementioned two. The world is also “Spatiotemporally Stable”: meaning that on ‘initializing’ the world at a specified date/time within the official lore timeline: everything and everyone within is physically stable and contextually consistent accordingly; and will furthermore progress forward in time in a manner expected to minimally diverge from the official timeline, and even then over a reasonably long period.”

knowledge/memories/personalities of any character or other entity defined by the input are ‘Physically Stable and Contextually Consistent [Accurate]’ to the input. The simulation will also be ‘temporally consistent’ if given a specified inception time: such that as time progresses, the evolution of the world will ‘reasonably’ converge upon the lore timeline for the remaining span of context clues given, then likewise diverge thereafter.”
