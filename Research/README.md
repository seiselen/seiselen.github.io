# Research Operations

**Blurb:** Papers, Articles, and Notes written/prepared by Steven Eiselen involving various research ops; including (i.e. mostly encompassing) Procedural Content Generation, Intelligent Agents, 3D Simulation Worlds, Game/Simulation Programming, Digital Physics (i.e. as analogous or equivalent to Simulation Hypothesis, Computational Univese theory, and Wolfram's Fundamental Theory of Physics), and misc. Computer Science / other projects as-applicable.

## Specific Research Projects/Initiatives:

+ **Project - Genesis:** Procedural Content Generation, encompassing both 'generator-end' techniques and 'user-end' workflows.

+ **Project - FÃ«a:** Simulating (Implementing) Personality, Emotions, Social Relationships, and Physical/Mental needs for NPC agents.

+ **Project - Glasshouse:** Utilization of 'Smart City' technologies for artificial biomes, specifically WRT offworld outposts/colonies.
