      <h1 style="text-align: center;">Target Use-Cases For Procedural Content Generation</h1>
      <hr>

      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Purpose and Introduction</h2>

      <p class="verz2P">
        <strong>Note:</strong> <em>This document was originally created in the Fall 2019 Semester as part of preliminary work towards one of the candidate topics for my [since suspended] Graduate Thesis Project</em>
      </p>

      <p class="verz2P">
        This document identifies and briefly discusses three possibile high-level applications of my Thesis Project, pursuant to Clay suggesting that we find applications from which to orient the work towards. A further suggestion (if I recall correctly) was to find applications that are, if possible, beyond the purpose of interactive entertainment and/or are pedagogical in nature and function. That said, I briefly also discuss applications towards interactive entertainment.
      </p>

      <p class="verz2P">
        There exist three 'Key Applications' of which I feel share enough similarities (in terms of purpose, requirements, authors, audience, and challenges) to have some of their respective demands served equally by the procedural generation solutions I wish to focus my research on. They are <strong>(1) Serious Games / Simulations</strong>, <strong>(2) Interactive Digital Storytelling</strong>, <strong>(3) Architectural Design / CAD</strong>, and as aforementioned: <strong>interactive entertainment</strong>. The similarities are discussed in the following section, while the applications themselves are discussed thereafter.
      </p>

      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Common Ground</h2>

      <p class="verz2P">
        The desire of the academy to be empowered with the ability to realize a serious game and/or interactive storytelling experience was consistent throughout my career as a Lab and Research Assistant at the Arizona Laboratory for Immersive Visualization Environments (AZ-LIVE), Creative Coding Lab (CCL), and Center for Digital Humanities (CCL). Many of my clients had a clear vision and desire for immersing students and peers in their narratives and/or research, but little to no ability to fully realize this; settling instead for more primitive interactive visualizations. The reason why is clear enough and encompasses a key motive for my research: lack of either funds to hire a team of professional video game developers, or otherwise talent within the University's student worker / grad assistant population to help develop the desired product.
      </p>

      <p class="verz2P">
        Beyond academicians is any individual or group with an excellent idea for a story, scenario, or narrative for which they wish to construct an immersive simulation; but lack the resources and capabilities of a leading video game studio to fully realize it, let alone those of a small indie studio for at least a basic realization. Thus the first objective of the 'Mission Statement' of my research as expressed in the document <strong>'Procedural Generation Interests'</strong>: 
      </p>

      <p class="quoteP">
        "Empower creators and explorers of simulated worlds from both the 'invisible walls and empty spaces' which hide the limitations that a finite team of humans face in producing both massive, highly detailed environments and the entities which live within them."
      </p>

      <p class="verz2P">
        In effect, then: one could say that my work also seeks to determine how and where procedural generation can/could be expanded as a means to 'democratize' the ability of producing large size/scaled, content-rich, open-world, immersive and interactive simulated environments to those who are not 'AAA game studios'; and for purposes of either improvement (as within an industry training simulation) and/or exploration (as within a 'story or fantasy come to life').
      </p>

      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Serious Games and Simulations</h2>

      <p class="verz2P">
        <strong>Serious Games and Simulations</strong> involve interactive experiences whose main purpose is either not or not solely entertainment. Examples range from industry training (e.g. 'Harry's Hard Choices'), to historical reenactment (e.g. 'Virtual Harlem'), and even the 'Sim' and 'Tycoon' video game genres whose franchises include 'The Sims', 'Sim City', and 'Civilization'. 
      </p>      

      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Interactive Digital Storytelling</h2>

      <p class="verz2P">
        <strong>Interactive Digital Storytelling</strong> encompasses narrative-based experiences of which some are also Serious Games. One example from the 'sociopolitical' sub-genre of Serious Games are those involving climate change set in the far future. As technically, any narrative counts: simulating 'Lord of The Rings' is as valid as simulating 'Pleasantville', which is as valid as 9/11 survivors simulating their stories of escape and rescue, which is as valid as the author of a science fiction short story shared freely on the internet simulating the world and narrative(s) described therein.
      </p>      

      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Architectural Design / CAD</h2>

      <p class="verz2P">
        <strong>Architectural Design / CAD (Computer Assisted Design)</strong> is self-explanatory, and follows from the revised thesis topic of generating accurate interior spaces corresponding to exterior context. Furthermore: Shape Grammars, one of the main PCG methods identified in my current research (and a likely primary method for my project), has significant precedent for the PCG of exterior buildings. One example is Wonka's paper "Interactive Visual Editing of Grammars for Procedural Architecture". The main goal of my research towards this field would involve allowing architectural designers to generate multiple configurations and styles of the interiors of their buildings.
      </p>      


      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Interactive Entertainment</h2>

      <p class="verz2P">
        <strong>Interactive Entertainment (i.e./a.k.a. Video Games)</strong> encompasses [video] game design and development. More specifically, the revised thesis topic would be most suitable towards empowering tools and/or techniques in the subfield of Level Design.
