		<H3> + 11/4/15 Progress: </H3>
		<ul> 
			<b>Official First Day of Deveopment.</b> I wrote a very rough cut of the Design Document / Game Bible from several smaller scale game ideas I had from as far back as 2012. It had been my dream for several years (and part the reason I went back to school and into Computer Science) to make virtual environments: particularly 'classic-style' RTS / management games like Westwood Studios' Command and Conquer series (before Electronic Arts bought it, so I stop at Tiberian Sun and reject games at/after Red Alert 2); and Blizzard's Starcraft 1 (trivia: alongside Runescape, the only two games I have ever played multiplayer in)
		</ul>
		<ul> 
			I also began to sculpt the UI. I planned for a Main Menu, an Audio submenu, a Create Game menu, and an in-game menu that would allow the player to exit the game, save the game, and go to the audio screen to change sfx and music settings, even allowing the player to select songs from a soundtrack		
		</ul>
		<ul> 
			During section, I met with my team who looked at / reviewed the spec. Ian suggested a 'win goal' of developing a cure - which is a pretty sweet idea so we're going with it. The rest of the working part of the day was spent doing some more conceptual drawings and planning to refine the design document, which I will pick up on Friday. The afternoon section meeting went over animation, giving me a gameplan for how to deal with unit anims; and Dan Vaugn reminded of the Factory Design Pattern which I will be using for unit creation (and maybe zombies too)...
		</ul>

			I was largely bogged down with AI stuff today, but managed to experiment a little with tilesets (images below). I have a general idea of how, in several 'phases', I'm going to create the procedural map of the landscape and have it looking good

		<H3> + 11/6/15 Progress: </H3>
		<ul> 
			Attended Section today - worked on more ideas per the in-game view and other views, as well as some game dynamics / features. For example: I'm going to implement units occupying buildings as just throwing different skins on the building as opposed to showing an interior with the units in it. This has some benefits, mainly being able to 'hide' units in buildings as opposed to having to render them which may save performance space and an easier implementation of the building being raided by zombies, damaged and even desroyed. Excited to play with that implementation!
		</ul>
		<ul> 
			I also created a Github site on my account for recording progress and updates (yep - the very one you're reading!) as a development blog as well. So stop by for more progress!
